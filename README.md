# Yunagi

Yunagi (Evening Calm) is a blog system based on Next.js and Markdown.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Why Yunagi?

~~Yunagi is a Japanese word that means "evening calm". It is a beautiful word that describes the calmness of the evening. I hope that this blog system can bring you the same feeling.~~ The name yunagi is from [one of nine Kamikaze-class destroyers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_destroyer_Y%C5%ABnagi_(1924)).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
